# 🚀 ClubMind AI - Intelligent Community Leadership Recommendation System

ClubMind AI is an AI-powered recommendation system that helps clubs, student communities, and organizations identify the most suitable members for leadership roles, event management, workshops, and team responsibilities.

The system uses semantic search, vector embeddings, and agent-based workflows to analyze member profiles and provide intelligent recommendations.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

In clubs and communities, assigning responsibilities is often based on manual judgment and limited visibility into member contributions.

As communities grow, it becomes difficult to:

* Identify the best candidate for leadership roles
* Recognize active contributors
* Match responsibilities with member skills
* Make data-driven decisions

ClubMind AI solves this by analyzing member information and recommending the most suitable candidates for specific roles.
